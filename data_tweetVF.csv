viruses,Craig Morton,https://twitter.com/_DrCJM_,And all the tests and experiments and controlled studies were done. Bacteriophage were identified. Plant viruses like tobacco mosaic virus were identified. These were easier because the disease they caused was simple to show. Then animal viruses were identified.2/2,2021-03-20T04:06:51.000Z
viruses,Mark B.,https://twitter.com/Maro2Bear,Looks like some kind of mosaic virus.  My fig trees often had.A mosaic virus is any virus that causes infected plant foliage to have a mottled appearance. Such viruses come from a variety of unrelated lineages and consequently there is no taxon that unites all mosaic viruses.,2022-06-06T21:03:19.000Z
